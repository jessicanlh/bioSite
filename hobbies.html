            <h2>Hobbies and Passions</h2>
            <p>Outside of work, Jane is an extrovert who thrives in social settings and loves immersing themselves in hobbies that bring joy and creativity. They enjoy hiking with their dog, Juno, exploring the world of cosplay (often experimenting with gender-fluid costumes) and spending time playing video games or creating art. Murder mystery parties and local events are their favorite ways to connect with others and unwind.</p>
            <p>Travel is another passion, and if time and money were no object, Jane would set off to explore all seven continents. While cruises are firmly off their bucket list, they’re open to visiting nearly anywhere they haven’t been before. Their dream of traveling also aligns with a long standing love for storytelling. Though a busy schedule has made writing a novel challenging, Jane aspires to one day become an author. </p>
