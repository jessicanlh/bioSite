            <h2>My Work</h2>
            <p>Jane is a passionate and dedicated case manager for Child Protective Services (CPS), with nearly a decade of experience working with families. With a background in psychology, Jane originally moved to Denver after graduating and stumbled into a social work. Over the years, they have not only provided support to families but also championed LGBTQ+ initiatives in the workplace, including organizing a booth at Denver Pride every year. For Jane, celebrating and supporting minority communities is not just work, itâ€™s a personal mission, especially in light of the current political climate. </p>
